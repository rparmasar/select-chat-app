It uses Twilio's API, Conversations primarily, as well as Mailchimp's Marketing API to create conversations as soon as a new subscriber is added to a Mailchimp List (Audience).

Design adapted from Twilio's Conversations Quickstart Demo (https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/quickstart?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=conversations_quickstart)
